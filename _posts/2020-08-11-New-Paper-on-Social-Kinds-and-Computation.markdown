The _Canadian Journal of Philosophy_ has published [my paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/can.2020.33) on what I call "Social-Computation-Supporting Kinds". This paper is a first attempt to re-describe the role of computation in social ontology. I argue -- in move I would self-servingly love to call "bold" --  that there is a kind of social kinds which is distinguished by supporting social computations, that is groups implementing computational processes. 

I want to stress that it is a first attempt and will leave many questions open. It's value lies, hopefully, in doing something different in the social kinds debate and sketching the value this new approach will have. I expect to publish more on this approach.

I also presented the gist of the paper at the recent online _Social Ontology_ conference. My video presentation from this conference is [still available](https://so2020.isosonline.org/conference/social-computation-supporting-kinds/) for those who don't want to read the paper.
