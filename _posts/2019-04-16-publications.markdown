Two of my publications are finally out. Both of them are related to my PhD research into social ontology and the both investigate groups. [The first](https://philpapers.org/rec/STRGMA-2) one discusses group membership and argues that reducing it to mereological parthood plus further conditions is a viable option. The paper has an unusual history. Originally, I wrote another paper that argued the opposite conclusion, that is I tried to establish that all mereological accounts of groups fail. However, Katherine Hawley published a paper in the debate in 2018 and after reading it I decided that she was right, that we cannot take mereological accounts of the map at this point. So instead of publishing my first paper, I wrote a new one, filling a significant gap in the mereological account. You can find out everything in this crisp little piece.

[My second paper](https://philpapers.org/rec/STRTTO-16) undertakes a more ambitious project. It defends the conclusion that current interpretivist accounts of group agency fail and have to fail while functionalist accounts have a better shot. Like the first one, this second paper draws on the ontology of groups. Coinciding groups, that is groups which share all their members at all times, pose a special problem to interpretivist accounts, or so I argue. 

I am proud to say that both papers have been published open access. As long as you have internet access, you can read them.
