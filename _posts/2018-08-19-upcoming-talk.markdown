I'm speaking this Friday (24th of August 2018) at the [Social Ontology conference](https://isosonline.org/page-18072). This event has a special significance for me because it takes place at Tufts University, which I visited for a term in 2017. I had a great time working together with Brian Epstein, who organises the conference, and generally had an amazing time in Boston. So I'm very much looking forward to speak there on *Group Agency and Homuncularism*. My paper will address whether the homuncular nature of group agents allows an objection against postulating them and if so, how strong this objection is.
