# MPhil Projects

These are proposals for MPhil project with the NLIP group. If you are an MPhil student in the ACS at Cambridge and you are interested in any of these projects, send me an email!

## Project 0: LLMs for 0-shot Word Sense Disambiguation
**Proposer:** David Strohmaier

**Supervisors:** David Strohmaier and Paula Buttery

Use LLMs for 0-shot word sense disambiguation and break the ceiling of human performance!

Word sense disambiguation has long been one of the biggest challenges in NLP. It has even been considered AI-complete. While recent advances using transformer models have started to reach the human ceiling, these breakthroughs typically rely on large amounts of data. For some dictionaries, such as the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary (CALD), no such extensive resources are available. Humans can nonetheless disambiguate words using CALD. Can machines do the same? You'll use LLMs to address this challenge and solve the problem of word sense disambiguation in a 0-shot setting.

You'll be provided with access to GPU resources and a digital version of CALD.
