I am a research associate in the Natural Language and Information Processing ([NLIP](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/)) group at the [University of Cambridge](https://cam.ac.uk). I am supported by the Institute for Automated Language Teaching and Assessment ([ALTA](http://alta.cambridgeenglish.org/)). My research focusses on natural language processing using neural networks and I have also published in social ontology. 

My career path has been highly interdisciplinary. I received an MA and PhD in philosophy from the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) in 2018. Afterwards, I completed an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. My MPhil project covered word sense disambiguation for semantic parsing and was supervised by [Prof. Ted Briscoe](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ejb1/). I received my undergraduate degrees in Sociology and Philosophy/Sociology from the [University of GÃ¶ttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html).
