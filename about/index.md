I have received a PhD in philosophy from the University of Sheffield and I have completed an MPhil in advanced computer science at the University of Cambridge. Currently I work as a research associate in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Cambridge. I am supported by the [ALTA institute](http://alta.cambridgeenglish.org/). My research focusses on natural language processing using neural networks and I have also published in social ontology. You can contact me at ds858@cam.ac.uk.
