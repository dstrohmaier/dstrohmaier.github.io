I am a research associate in the Natural Language and Information Processing ([NLIP](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/)) group at the [University of Cambridge](https://cam.ac.uk). In this role, I am supported by the Institute for Automated Language Teaching and Assessment ([ALTA](http://alta.cambridgeenglish.org/)). My research focusses on natural language processing using neural networks. I also have a long-standing interest in decision theory. Previously, I have published in social ontology, particularly on the nature of social groups.

My career path has been highly interdisciplinary. I received an MA and in 2018 a PhD in philosophy from the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/). [Prof. Robert Stern](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/philosophy/people/academic-staff/robert-stern) supervised my PhD thesis. 

After my PhD in philosophy, I completed an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. My MPhil project covered word sense disambiguation for semantic parsing and was supervised by [Prof. Ted Briscoe](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ejb1/). I received my undergraduate degrees in Sociology and Philosophy/Sociology from the [University of GÃ¶ttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html).

I am always looking for feedback and cooperation. If you want to comment on my blog, work together, or complain, email me at [{{ site.email }}][email].

This blog uses the Jekyll blog generator with a variation of the plain-html-blog theme. I've changed it a lot since then.

You can find the source code for the original theme on GitHub:
