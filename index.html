<p><em>"I am one of those who are very willing to be refuted if I say anything which is not true, and very willing to refute any one else who says what is not true, and quite as ready to be refuted as to refute- for I hold that this is the greater gain of the two, just as the gain is greater of being cured of a very great evil than of curing another."</em> - Socrates, Gorgias (A reminder for myself)</p>
