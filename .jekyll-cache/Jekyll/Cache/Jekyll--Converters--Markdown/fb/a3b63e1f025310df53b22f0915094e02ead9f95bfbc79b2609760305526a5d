I"‘<p>My <a href="http://dstrohmaier.com/why-learn-prolog-in-2021/">recent blog post</a> arguing why one should lean Prolog in 2021 made its way to the front page of Hacker News (HN), where it started a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25652369">discussion</a> with more than 100 comments. Iâ€™m glad to see that some saw value in my post and I want to respond to a few comments from this discussion. Given the number of comments, I wonâ€™t write an exhaustive response but instead focus on a few themes I care about and try to fill some gaps I left in my original post. This post will be more eclectic and discuss:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How to evaluate the time investment into Prolog</li>
  <li>Where the unfulfilled potential of Prolog might lie</li>
  <li>Why I focussed on Prolog rather than another logic programming language</li>
  <li>The aesthetic and epistemic reasons for learning Prolog</li>
</ol>
