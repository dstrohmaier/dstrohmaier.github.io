I"þ<p>Over the years there have been a number of visualisations of Wittgensteinâ€™s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Most of them have made use of the tree structure Wittgenstein imposed on his text. With todayâ€™s web-technologies, <a href="https://homepage.univie.ac.at/noichlm94/posts/tractatus/">these</a> <a href="https://pbellon.github.io/tractatus-tree/">representations</a> of the text can be excellent. In this post, however, I present a map of the Tractatus unlike any of these previous experiments.</p>
