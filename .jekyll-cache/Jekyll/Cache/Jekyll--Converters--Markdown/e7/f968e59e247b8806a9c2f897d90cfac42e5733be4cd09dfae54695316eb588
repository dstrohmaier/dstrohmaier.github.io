I"z<p>I’ve recently posted a short list of <a href="http://dstrohmaier.com/philosophy/2019/12/23/Best-of-Social-Ontology-2019.html">social ontology highlights from 2019</a>, but <a href="http://philosophy.indiana.edu/people/ludwig.shtml">Kirk Ludwig</a> sent me a much more extensive list.

</ul>

<h2 id="near-future">Near Future</h2>
<p>Kirk also had some forthcoming publications on his list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anika Fiebich’s edited book <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030297824">Minimal Cooperation and Shared Agency</a> has slid into 2020:</li>
  <li>An issue of <em>Language and Communication</em> is coming out on group speech acts but the papers are already <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/language-and-communication/special-issue/10K75XZFFJ3">available online</a></li>
  <li>Saba Bazargan-Forward, Deborah Tollefsen (eds.): <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Handbook-of-Collective-Responsibility-1st-Edition/Bazargan-Forward-Tollefsen/p/book/9781138092242">The Routledge Handbook of Collective Responsibility</a></li>
</ul>

<p>That is quite a list and I have to admit that I was not aware of much that Kirk found. I hope others can benefit from it as well.</p>
