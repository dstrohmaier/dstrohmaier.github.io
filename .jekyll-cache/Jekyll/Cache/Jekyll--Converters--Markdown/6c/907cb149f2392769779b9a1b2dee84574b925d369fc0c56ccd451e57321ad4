I"f<p>Two of my publications are finally out. Both of them are related to my PhD research into social ontology and the both investigate groups. <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/STRGMA-2">The first</a> one discusses group membership and argues that reducing it to mereological parthood plus further conditions is a viable option. The paper has an unusual history. Originally, I wrote another paper that argued the opposite conclusion, that is I tried to establish that all mereological accounts of groups fail. However, Katherine Hawley published a paper in the debate in 2018 and after reading it I decided that she was right, that we cannot take mereological accounts of the map at this point. So instead of publishing my first paper, I wrote a new one, filling a significant gap in the mereological account. You can find out everything in this crisp little piece.</p>
