I"Š<p>The <em>Canadian Journal of Philosophy</em> has published <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/can.2020.33">my paper</a> on what I call â€œSocial-Computation-Supporting Kindsâ€. This paper is a first attempt to re-describe the role of computation in social ontology. I argue â€“ in move I would self-servingly love to call â€œboldâ€ â€“  that there is a kind of social kinds which is distinguished by supporting social computations, that is groups implementing computational processes.</p>

<p>I want to stress that it is a first attempt and will leave many questions open. Itâ€™s value lies, hopefully, in doing something different in the social kinds debate and sketching the value this new approach will have. I expect to publish more on this approach.</p>

<p>The paper is once again published Open Access, thanks to the University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>I also presented the gist of the paper at the recent online <em>Social Ontology</em> conference. My video presentation from this conference is <a href="https://so2020.isosonline.org/conference/social-computation-supporting-kinds/">still available</a> for those who donâ€™t want to read the paper.</p>
