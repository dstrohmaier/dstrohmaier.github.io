<p>I am a research associate in the Natural Language and Information Processing (<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/">NLIP</a>) group at the <a href="https://cam.ac.uk">University of Cambridge</a>. In this role, I am supported by the Institute for Automated Language Teaching and Assessment (<a href="http://alta.cambridgeenglish.org/">ALTA</a>). My research focusses on natural language processing using neural networks. In addition, I have published in social ontology.</p>

<p>My career path has been highly interdisciplinary. I received an MA and PhD in philosophy from the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/">University of Sheffield</a> in 2018. Afterwards, I completed an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. My MPhil project covered word sense disambiguation for semantic parsing and was supervised by <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ejb1/">Prof. Ted Briscoe</a>. I received my undergraduate degrees in Sociology and Philosophy/Sociology from the <a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html">University of GÃ¶ttingen</a>.</p>

<p>I am always looking for feedback and cooperation. If you want to comment on my blog, work together, or complain, email me at <a href="mailto:ds858@cam.ac.uk">ds858@cam.ac.uk</a>.</p>
