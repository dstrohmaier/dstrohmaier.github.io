I"í<p>The <em>Canadian Journal of Philosophy</em> has published <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/can.2020.33">my paper</a> on what I call â€œSocial-Computation-Supporting Kindsâ€. This paper is a first attempt to re-describe the role of computation in social ontology. I argue â€“ in move I would self-servingly love to call â€œboldâ€ â€“  that there is a kind of social kinds which is distinguished by supporting social computations, that is groups implementing computational processes.</p>
