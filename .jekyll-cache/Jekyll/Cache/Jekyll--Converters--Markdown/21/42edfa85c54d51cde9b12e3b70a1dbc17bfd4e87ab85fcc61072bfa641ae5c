I"Q<p>Social ontology, by which I mean a subfield of contemporary analytic philosophy, is a comparatively small enterprise so far. That makes gathering a best-of-2019 list difficult. There just aren’t that many great papers coming out each year, or other notable events. Here are five highlights I could find. Feel free to send me an email and suggest other contributions to the field. I might update this entry later.</p>

<p>Brian Epstein’s paper <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/EPSWAS-2">“What are social groups? Their metaphysics and how to classify them”</a> has been available as forthcoming for a while, but the official publication date has been 2019, which hopefully justifies including it in this list.[0]</p>

<p>The International Social Ontology Society has started a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHANz5VREBjb_TBoWx0a8A">Youtube channel</a> this year and published keynotes from last years conference.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://isosonline.org/SO2019">Social Ontology conference in Tampere</a>, organised by the European Network of Social Ontology. I believe the keynotes have been recorded, so there is hope that they will appear on ISOS Youtube channel at some point.</p>

<p>Finally, there has been a monist issue on the topic of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/monist/issue/102/2"><em>Collective Responsibility and Social Ontology</em></a>.</p>

<p>BONUS: Arto Laitinen has told me that a book symposium on Ásta’s <em>Categories We Live By</em> will soon appear in the <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jso">Journal of Social Ontology</a> (and dated as being from 2019).</p>

<p><em>Footnotes</em></p>

<p>[0] Two other publications on the ontology of groups deserve honourable mentions, even though they have appeared in 2018 (as forthcoming without a date yet in the first case). The first is Katherine Ritchie’s <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/RITSSA-4">“Social Structures and the Ontology of Social Groups”</a> and the second is Gabriel Uzquiano’s <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/UZQGTA">“Groups: Toward a Theory of Plural Embodiment”</a>.</p>
