I"©<p>I am presenting at the 2020 Social Ontology Conference and because it is virtual, you can all watch it online. The <a href="https://so2020.isosonline.org/">conference website</a> provides videos of all talks.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://so2020.isosonline.org/conference/social-computation-supporting-kinds/">talk</a>, I discuss the notion of social-computation-supporting kinds. A longer paper exploring the idea will hopefully be published soon. The main advantage of the video is the excellent pixel art.</p>

<p>There will also be a Q&amp;A session, but they havenâ€™t been scheduled yet.</p>
