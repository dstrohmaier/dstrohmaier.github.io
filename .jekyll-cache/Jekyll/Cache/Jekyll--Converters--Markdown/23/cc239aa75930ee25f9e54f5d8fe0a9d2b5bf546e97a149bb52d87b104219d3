I"j<p>What has 2020 brought? In this post I want to offer a selective reflection on my research career and its developments in 2020. I will take a perspective that is at the same time deeply personal and highly abstract. From my personal heights, I’ll gesture at the turns I’ve taken this year, note a few outcomes, and point towards my future commitments.</p>
