Looking at two aspectes of them human motivational system we can understand autonomy better.[0] I suggest that by paying more attention to the algorithimic and systematic side of our motivations and motivational change we get a better grasp on how we manage to direct ourselves as agents. These features play a big role


Algorithmic 
Philosophical debates of autonomy 

Systematic
The systematic nature of our motivational states, that they are not just atomic motivations -- a like for this and a dislike for that -- but are connected in complex manners (enabled by their compositional character). Some of the philosophical discourse is already capturing this systematicity. Frankfurt's second-order motivational states are a step in that direction, and there are many more examples. 
So far, however, the computational and cognitive perspective on this systematic nature of our motivations has been neglected in discussing autonomy (If I'm wrong about that, please email me relevant references!).







[0] What does it mean to understand autonomy better? I suggest that there is core of connected phenomena, mainly computational in nature, we often get at when we talk about and which we sometimes value when they are presented in the right light.
