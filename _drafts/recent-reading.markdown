- Karl Sigmund: *Exact Thinking in Demented Times*
An excellent book on the Vienna Circle. Not a philosopher's scholarly treatise but an introduction for the public, Sigmund tells the personal and intellectual history of this influential group and its associates. We learn about the early debate between Mach and Boltzmann about the existence of Atemos and soon the accusations of metaphysics are swirling. The famous, although not exactly well-documented, anecdote of Wittgenstein's poker also had to be included.

While I find the philosophical versatility and boldness of the Vienna Circle inspiring, as someone who went to School in Vienna I cannot help but feel bitterness at the end of the book. As a work of history, it had to end where it ended. There is no reasonable doubt about who destroyed the intellectual fertility of Austria's soil documented by Sigmund: The Austrians. First by plunging head-first into World War I, then under Dollfu√ü' Catholic-Authoritarian Krukenkreuz, and finally by joining German Nationalsocialism. Never much more than tolerated, the Circle finally got crushed by the historical atrocities the Austrian and German people committed. Philosophy in Vienna has never found back to its earlier greatness.
