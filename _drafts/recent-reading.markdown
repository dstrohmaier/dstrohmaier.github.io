- Karl Sigmund: *Exact Thinking in Demented Times*
Not a philospher's scholarly treatise, but an excellent book on the Vienna Circle. In this introduction for the public, Sigmund tells the personal and intellectual history of the influential Vienna Circle and its associates. We learn about the early debate between Mach and Boltzmann concerning the existence of atoms and soon the accusations of metaphysics are swirling. The famous, although not exactly well-documented, anecdote about Wittgenstein's poker also had to be included. Philosophical arguments don't receive as much attention as I would have liked, but the book serves as a reminder that philosophical debates take place in a more general intellectual environment and that the quality of the positions depends on this environment. The new developments in the sciences made the old Neo-Kantian positions look rather silly even though the argument for why that is so isn't straightforward (I expect the recently emerging Neo-Neo-Kantians to push back against that).

While I find the philosophical versatility and boldness of the Vienna Circle inspiring, as someone who group in Austria and went to School in Vienna I coulnd't help but feel bitterness at the end of the book. As a work of history, it had to end where it ended. First, Austria and its people plunged head-first into World War I, then the remainders of Austria trampled on intellectual liberty under Dollfu√ü' Catholic-Authoritarian Krukenkreuz, and finally they joined German Nationalsocialism. Never much more than tolerated, the Circle finally got crushed amidst the historical atrocities the Austrian and German people committed. Few took any notice in those demented times. Who would today?

- Subrata Dasgupta: *It Began with Babbage*
This book served my purposes. I wanted an introduction to the history of computer science to make it easier for me to construct a cognitive map of what I'm learning. Dasgupta included just enough technical details for that to be possible while keeping the book light enough for reading it on the train. It didn't make me an expert on the history of computing, but it will allow me to recognise historical key innovations (stored-program computer, context-free grammar, finite state machines,...) and place them in their context when I encounter them.

Dasgupta draws on Thomas Kuhn's well-known work on scientific revolutions but I wish he hadn't. The talk of paradigms helps little and I find it distracting, because I want to start arguing why Kuhn's framework is misguided. The references to Kuhn's theory are most interesting when Dasgupta admits that Kuhn's bold claim don't really match on to what happened during the birth of computer science.
