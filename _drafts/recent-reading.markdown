- John von Neumann: *The Computer & the Brain*

Cancer kept John von Neumann from finishing his Silliman lectures. They are nonetheless an impressive document of the computational revolution during the first half of the 20th century. The introductions of the 2012 edition emphasise how well the book holds up to current research, but more importantly the book still can inspire future inquiries.

- Richard Bradley: *Decision Theory with a Human Face*

I'm writing a proper review of this book, so suffice here that it is a well-researched defence of Bayesian decision theory as a normative theory for agents with incomplete attitudes, who are not perfectly logical, and have to face severe uncertainty. In other words, a book about the rationality requirements on actual human beings.


- Bryan Lee O'Malley: *Lost at Sea*

This coming-of-age graphic novel, or rather graphic novella, exceeded my expectations. It manages to be popular and subtle, to combine genre tropes with original themes. It shows just enough to draw us in.
