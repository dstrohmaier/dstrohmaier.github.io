I have a hard time interpreting Lewis' "Radical Interpretation". I cannot get my head around why Lewis would go for the following set-up:
- We look at a single individual
- The single individual is treated as undifferentiated physical system





Another aspect of this paper which strikes me as odd is how Lewis justifies his employment of decision theory. 


> Decision theory (at least, if we omit the frills) is not esoteric science, however unfamiliar it may seem to an outside. Rather, it is a systematic exposition of the consequences of certain well-chosen platitudes about belief, desire, preference, and choice. It is the very core of our common-sense theory of persons, dissected out and elegantly systematized. (p. 337-338)

I find that hard to belief and what I find even harder to belief is that Lewis feels confident to asserting it without providing any argument or evidence for it. While I am myself happy to use decision theory for the purpose of philosophy, I would not venture the claim that it amounts to an "elegantly systematized" version of "the very core of our common-sense theory of persons". For one I would have assumed that this core included something about emotions such as fear, anger, affection, which are not well-covered by classical decision theory. In addition to missing important aspects, decision theory also appears overly specific. Lewis goes so far as to endorse
