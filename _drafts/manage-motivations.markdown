Although in recent years the literature on preference change has grown, our formal treatments of motivational change are still lacking. We do not understand well how we our motivational landscape develops. I want to suggest that at the same time we manage each other's motivations.

We can distinguish the superficial from the deep cases. When I offer the baker 50 pence for a roll, I manage her motivations. I make her want to give me that roll. But there is no great mystery in what I'm doing here, only the use of an incentive. The interesting cases are those, where we do not change the material incentives the other faces and still succeed in changing their motivational landscape.

Consider a case in which I try to persuade a friend. I try to make him see that ?? In some cases, I am merely providing information they lacked before. While these instances are perhaps already more subtle than my baker example, there are still more complex cases.
