[Picture of David Strohmaier](assets/images/small_me.jpg)


My work crosses the divides between philosophy, computer science, and the social sciences. I investigate the fundamental ontology of the social and the dynamics of human agents. The flexible and social character of human agency confronted with changing situations fascinates me. 

I also work in natural language processing and computational linguistics.

For my CV click [here](assets/pdf/cv_strohmaier.pdf).

I have received a PhD in philosophy from the University of Sheffield and I have completed an MPhil in advanced computer science at the University of Cambridge. You can contact me at davidstrohmaier92@gmail.com.
