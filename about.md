I am fascinated by how flexible human agency can be in confrontation with changing situations. You go out the door in the morning assuming you can grab your breakfast at the usual place. Turns out, it's closed for renovation. In response to this experience you have to make up your mind quickly. Do you have time to get something else? Do you know any place nearby? Would anyone mind if you came five minutes late? Could you stand an empty stomach until lunch? All this might go through your head while you keep running through the street.

The human capacity to respond flexible to changing situations becomes even more impressive in combination with our social nature. How do we put all this together? *The Way of Inquiry* will report from my engagement with this question and related issues.
