I will give two talks about Philosophy and AI in the next few weeks (February 2025).

## Workshop on Contrafactives

- When: February 6-7, 2025
- Where: University of DÃ¼sseldorf

The workshop "How we do (not) talk about mistaken beliefs" will bring
together researchers interested in the phenomenon of contrafactive
predicates: ascription verbs that denote attitudes by which people get
things wrong. According to current knowledge, no such ascription verbs
are lexicalised.

At this workshop, I will present the most recent results and some
general conclusions from my long running research project into the
learnability of contrafactives (joint work with Simon Wimmer). We
tested whether transformer networks can acquire contrafactive
predicates. The answer is positive but attend the talk (or wait for
future publications) to learn about the bigger lessons.

If you are interested, our previous papers on this topic are:
1. [Contrafactives and Learnability](https://philpapers.org/rec/STRCAL-6) (2022)
2. [Contrafactives and Learnability: An Experiment with Propositional Constants](https://philpapers.org/rec/STRCAL-7) (2023)
3. [Contrafactives, Learnability, and Production](https://philpapers.org/rec/STRCLA-3) (2025)


## Non-Human Entities and AI

- When:  February 20-22, 2025
- Where: University of Heidelberg

At Heidelberg, I will join the symposium on "Artificial Intelligence
and Non-Human Entities: In Search of Synergies from Various
Philosophical Debates". I will draw on my previous research on social
ontology to compare organisations and LLMs. Without giving too much
away, my talk will discuss how our ascriptions from the intentional
stance play different roles in the cases of  organisations and LLMs.

Interestingly, at the end of my paper, I found myself discussing some
of the memes swirling around in the twitter AI debate. So if you want
to see me draw the connection between social ontology, LLMs, and the
Leviathan with a smiling face, this will be your opportunity.

My previous research in this area includes:
1. [Ontology, neural networks, and the social sciences](https://philpapers.org/rec/STRONN) (2020)
2. [Organisations as Computing Systems](https://philpapers.org/rec/STROAC-2) (2021)
3. [Social-Computation-Supporting Kinds.](https://philpapers.org/rec/STRSK) (2020)
4. [Two theories of group agency](https://philpapers.org/rec/STRTTO-16) (2020)
