This post collects a set of reflections on the Symbol Grounding Problem in the context of LLMs. In this context, the question is whether LLM systems have an appropriate connection to the world. The appropriate connections are presumed to establish that the representations and output of the models are meaningful.

You can find a [list of papers](/The-Symbol-Grounding-Problem/) on this topic on my page. My use of the term "Symbol Grounding Problem" is broad and encompasses what others have, for example, called the ["Vector Grounding Problem"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01481).

## Reflections

1. One goal of AI research is to fully replicate human cognitive abilities.

2. Comparing to debates in philosophy of mind, a distinction between an easy and a hard problem of symbol grounding in AI systems can be drawn.[^1]

    * 2.1. The easy problem of symbol grounding is the challenge of creating an AI system that can process multi-modal data and integrate the information these data sources provide. It is an engineering problem on the road to fully replicating human cognitive abilities.

    * 2.2. The hard problem of symbol grounding is the challenge of having the words or internal vehicles of AI systems carry intrinsic meaning and *establishing* that they do so. Establishing the success of the engineering problem, is part of the challenge. BOTH PARTS

        - 2.2.1 The hard problem of symbol grounding, thus, has an engineering and an epistemic component.

    * 2.3. Whether solving the easy grounding problem guarantees that words (or internal vehicles) created by the AI system carry intrinsic meaning, is a sub-question of the hard problem of symbol grounding.

3. As in the case of the hard problem of consciousness, the motivation for the hard problem of symbol grounding is open to debate.

    * 3.1. The hard problem of symbol grounding is inextricably linked to meta-semantic theories of meaning.

    * 3.2. One way of motivating OTHER WORD?
    Assuming having phenomenal consciousness is required for a system to carry meaning, the hard problem of symbol grounding requires a solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

    * 3.3. Another motivation for the hard problem of symbol grounding is provided by semantic externalism. If historic causal interaction is required for a system to carry meaning, then the addressing the hard problem of symbol grounding requires us to put the system in such causal interactions and establish that it fulfils the conditions of semantic externalism.

4. The relevance of the engineering component of the hard problem of symbol grounding for computer science INCLUDING AI RESEARCH is unresolved.

   * 4.1. It is conceivable that addressing the engineering component of the hard symbol grounding problem is not strictly necessary for a system to fully replicate human cognitive abilities.

   * 4.2. Even if that is so, it could be the case that addressing the engineering component of the hard problem is relevant for computer science due to being associated with a particular solution path towards replicating human cognitive abilities. For example, solving the engineering aspect of the hard problem could be necessary for implementing the computationally most efficient way of replicating human cognitive abilities.

   * 4.3. Even if the engineering component of the hard problem is completely irrelevant to computer science, TIE TO FIRST HALF UNCLEAR one of the

 TO BE REPLICATED human cognitive abilities _might be that we can establish whether_ BAD PHRASING the vehicles or output of a system carry meaning.

       - 4.3.1. Replicating human abilities would then require GIVING the AI system THE ABILITY to address the epistemic component of the hard problem of symbol grounding.

       - 4.3.2. Providing an AI system with a meta-semantic theory of meaning might be all that is needed for replicating our ability of establishing whether something carries meaning.
