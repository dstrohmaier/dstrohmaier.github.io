For the fourth year in a row, I will present a paper at a [social ontology](https://isosonline.org/SO2019) conference this Summer. After the last one in Boston, I thought it would be time to do something more ambitious. While my previous papers went well enough and led to two publications, they made relatively narrow arguments. This year in Tampere my claims will be much bolder. I do not want to give too much away, but I will propose a sweeping change to how we explain the social and what makes it special from a metaphysical perspective. What makes social interesting should be fundamentally reconceived.

You should not miss this momentous event. If you do, you can email me at davidstrohmaier92@gmail.com to get an early draft of my paper.
