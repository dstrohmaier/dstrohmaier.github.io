Now available, [an open-access introduction to preference change](http://doi.org/10.1017/9781009181860)!

When I got into the topic of preference change, a few years back by now, such an introduction was sorely lacking. I hope many readers find it of value. Much research on preference change remains to be done and I hope the readers can help with that!

Michael Messerli and I have co-authored the book, which has been published by Cambridge University Press in the Elements Series for Decision Theory and Philosophy. I greatly enjoyed working with Michael and everyone else involved in the process of getting this book together. Thank you!
