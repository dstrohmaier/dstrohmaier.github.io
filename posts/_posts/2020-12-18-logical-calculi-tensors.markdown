Can we simulate basic logic operations, i.e. the operations of first-order predicate logic, using tensors? In his 2013 paper "Towards a Formal Distributional Semantics: Simulating Logical Calculi with Tensors", Edward Grefenstette made some suggestions for such simulation.  The paper's motivation was to take a step towards combining distributional with formal semantics. I've explored this paper in a Jupyter Notebook, which I put on [github](https://github.com/dstrohmaier/logic_with_tensors/blob/master/logical_calculi_tensors.ipynb).

At the moment, the github notebook viewer breaks some of the LaTex formulas, but you can see it in the Jupyter notebook viewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dstrohmaier/logic_with_tensors/blob/master/logical_calculi_tensors.ipynb).
