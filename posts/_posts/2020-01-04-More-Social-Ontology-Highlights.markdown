I've recently posted a short list of [social ontology highlights from 2019](http://dstrohmaier.com/philosophy/2019/12/23/Best-of-Social-Ontology-2019.html), but [Kirk Ludwig](http://philosophy.indiana.edu/people/ludwig.shtml) sent me a much more extensive list. I present it here in rearranged form.

## Events
On top of Kirk's list was the [Social Ontology/ENSO conference in Tampere](https://events.tuni.fi/socialontology2019/), which I had already on my list. Otherwise there were three workshops/conferences at Vienna on:
* [Social Agency, Group Agency & Relational Normativity](https://groupagency.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/p_groupagency/Program_Conference_Social_Agency.pdf)
* [Group Agency and Collective Responsibility](https://groupagency.univie.ac.at/events/workshops-and-conferences/workshop-group-agency-and-collective-responsibility/)
* [Shared Agency, Rationality, Normativity ](https://groupagency.univie.ac.at/events/workshops-and-conferences/workshop-shared-agency-rationality-normativity/ ) (with Michael Bratman and David Velleman)

There were two events in Milan:
* Adelaide de Lastic "The Political Dimension of an Enterpriseâ€™s Collective Agency", Thursday 28 March 2019
* [A Pragmatist take on Social Ontology: Habits, Social Practices, Statuses]( http://www.dipafilo.unimi.it/ecm/home/aggiornamenti-e-archivi/tutte-le-notizie/content/28-novembre-2019-italo-testa-a-pragmatist-take-on-social-ontology-habits-social-practices-statuses.0000.UNIMIDIRE-81494)

Other events:
* The [2019 Pacific APA meeting had a symposium](https://www.apaonline.org/event/2019pacific) on Kirk's second book, [From Plural to Institutional Agency: Collective Action 2](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/from-plural-to-institutional-agency-9780198789994). (With Maria Jankovic and Carol Rovane as commentators)
* [Workshop on Social Ontology, Normativity, and Philosophy of Law](https://socialontologyglasgow.wordpress.com/events/), Glasgow University Law School, May 30-31
* [European Network for Philosophy of the Social Sciences (ENPOSS)](http://enposs.eu/past-enposs-2/) in Athens
* The [PPE Society meeting in spring 2019](https://ppesociety.org/the-2019-ppe-society-meeting/) also featured some social ontology papers

## Near Future
Kirk also had some forthcoming publications on his list:
* Anika Fiebich's edited book [Minimal Cooperation and Shared Agency](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030297824) has slid into 2020:
* An issue of *Language and Communication* is coming out on group speech acts but the papers are already [available online](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/language-and-communication/special-issue/10K75XZFFJ3)
* Saba Bazargan-Forward, Deborah Tollefsen (eds.): [The Routledge Handbook of Collective Responsibility](https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Handbook-of-Collective-Responsibility-1st-Edition/Bazargan-Forward-Tollefsen/p/book/9781138092242)


That is quite a list and I have to admit that I was not aware of much that Kirk found. I hope others can benefit from it as well.
