I'm presenting a poster at the upcoming [CoNLL workshop](https://conll.org/) in Vienna collocated with the main [ACL conference](https://2025.aclweb.org/). The poster summarises our paper on the _Cambridge Dictionary Look-Up_ dataset and our preliminary results on it. If you are around, come check it out at either of the two poster sessions!

You can find the paper [online on OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WLZmO6eFXR). The public portions of the dataset are available on [the ELiT website](https://englishlanguageitutoring.com/datasets/cambridge-dictionary-look-up-dataset).

We'll release more data at a later time. If you have any questions about the dataset, feel free send me an email!
