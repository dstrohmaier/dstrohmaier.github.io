I regularly use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for managing my bibliographies. I then usually typeset my writings in LaTex, citing references with BibLaTeX. For exporting BibLaTeX .bib files, I recommend the ["Better BibTeX" extension](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex). But sometimes I prefer to attach citations to my clipboard rather than have to export an entire .bib file. For BibTeX, there exists a [bibliography style](https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=bibtex) that allows Zotero users to do so. I've now start to adapt this file to BibLateX. It is still a work-in-progress and you should not trust its output, but if you want o have a look, you can find it [here](https://github.com/dstrohmaier/biblatex_csl).
