I have two upcoming events to share:

## NLP4CALL Workshop

I will present my paper "Semantic Error Prediction: Estimating Word
Production Complexity" (co-authored with Paula Buttery) at this year's
[NLP4CALL]() workshop. The presentation is this Friday 25th of October
2024.

The paper is already [available
online](https://ecp.ep.liu.se/index.php/sltc/article/download/1055/961). It
argues that lexical semantic complexity _in production_ hat its own
distinct patterns and proposed semantic error prediction (SEP) as a
task to estimate this kind of complexity. I build some baseline models
for this task, including one using LLama2 and also provide a
downstream application as an example.

If you are interested in SEP, I provide the scripts for re-creating my
dataset as a [github
repo](https://github.com/dstrohmaier/semantic_error_prediction/).

If you have any issues and questions, feel free to email me!


## Barcelona Masterclass

On the 7th of November 2024, I will hold a [masterclass on LLMs for
philosophers](http://www.ub.edu/grc_logos/colloquium_card.php?idSem=3356)
in Barcelona. At this event, I will introduce LLMs in more depth
without requiring any deeper mathematical or programming knowledge (no
linear algebra or Python). I hope to put up some of the materials
online at a later date.
