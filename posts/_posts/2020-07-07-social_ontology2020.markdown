I am presenting at the 2020 Social Ontology Conference and because it is virtual, you can all watch it online. The [conference website](https://so2020.isosonline.org/) provides videos of all talks.

In my [talk](https://so2020.isosonline.org/conference/social-computation-supporting-kinds/), I discuss the notion of social-computation-supporting kinds. A longer paper exploring the idea will hopefully be published soon. The main advantage of the video is the excellent pixel art.

There will also be a Q&A session, but they haven't been scheduled yet.
