Social ontology, by which I mean a subfield of contemporary analytic philosophy, is a comparatively small enterprise so far. That makes gathering a best-of-2019 list difficult. There just aren't that many great papers coming out each year, or other notable events. Here are five highlights I could find. Feel free to send me an email and suggest other contributions to the field. I might update this entry later.

Brian Epstein's paper ["What are social groups? Their metaphysics and how to classify them"](https://philpapers.org/rec/EPSWAS-2) has been available as forthcoming for a while, but the official publication date has been 2019, which hopefully justifies including it in this list.[0]

The International Social Ontology Society has started a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHANz5VREBjb_TBoWx0a8A) this year and published keynotes from last years conference.

The [Social Ontology conference in Tampere](https://isosonline.org/SO2019), organised by the European Network of Social Ontology. I believe the keynotes have been recorded, so there is hope that they will appear on ISOS Youtube channel at some point.

Finally, there has been a monist issue on the topic of [*Collective Responsibility and Social Ontology*](https://academic.oup.com/monist/issue/102/2).

BONUS: Arto Laitinen has told me that a book symposium on √Åsta's *Categories We Live By* will soon appear in the [Journal of Social Ontology](https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jso) (and dated as being from 2019).

*Footnotes*

[0] Two other publications on the ontology of groups deserve honourable mentions, even though they have appeared in 2018 (as forthcoming without a date yet in the first case). The first is Katherine Ritchie's ["Social Structures and the Ontology of Social Groups"](https://philpapers.org/rec/RITSSA-4) and the second is Gabriel Uzquiano's ["Groups: Toward a Theory of Plural Embodiment"](https://philpapers.org/rec/UZQGTA).
